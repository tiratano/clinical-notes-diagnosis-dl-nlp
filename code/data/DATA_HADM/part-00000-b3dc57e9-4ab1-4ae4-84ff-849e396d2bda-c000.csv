Please see previous discharge summary for information on patient's admission diagnosis and medications. HOSPITAL COURSE: 1.  Gastrointestinal.  On [**10-16**] the patient developed nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain.  Because of this she was not discharged to rehabilitation at [**Location (un) 511**] Center Hospital as had been previously planned.  Due to her symptoms a CT scan was obtained which revealed the patient had an ileus. There were no abscesses or other processes that could be identified.  The neurology service was consulted regarding possibility of this ileus being related to the patient's myopathy but felt this was unlikely since skeletal muscle myopathies typically do not also involve smooth muscle of the Gastrointestinal tract.  A Gastrointestinal consult was obtained who had no additional thoughts on what could be causing the patient's ileus and recommended bowel rest. The patient was kept off tube feeds for two days after which time they were restarted at a low rate of 20 cc's an hour as compared to her goal rate of 65 cc's per hour.  The patient appeared to tolerate this reasonably well and the tube feeds were increased.  When they reached the rate of 30 cc's an hour however the patient developed nausea and vomiting a second time.  Tube feeds were again stopped and her bowel was rested for several days. On [**10-24**] it was decided that because the patient was unable to tolerate tube feeds at a reasonable rate she would be started on TPN for nutrition.  At the time of this dictation on [**10-27**] the patient was reporting decreased abdominal pain and no further nausea or vomiting.  She additionally had been successful in moving her bowels and treated with Colace, Senokot and Fleet enemas.  The suspicion of the team at this point in time is that her ileus is resolving however, very slowly.  Her tube feeds will need to be started at a very slow rate, advanced extremely gently as tolerated with caution being taken because when the rate is increased to abruptly she does tend to develop nausea and vomiting.  She will be discharged out on no tube feeds, they can be started when she arrives at [**Location (un) 511**] Center for rehabilitation. She will be discharged out on TPN which she can continue. Additionally we will maintain her on [**Doctor Last Name **] and Colace. 2.  Pulmonary.  The patient continued to do well on a trach mask and in fact tolerated trach mask ventilation for five days in a row with no support from mechanical ventilator. Because of this she was deemed safe to go to the floor something which the team and the patient's family were very happy with as it was thought this could be a trial preliminary to transferring her to rehabilitation home.  On [**10-21**] she was transferred to the floor. Unfortunately however, on [**10-22**] she was found to be hypoxic to the low 80's on the floor.  She was suctioned with thick tenacious dark secretions came out, her O2 sats increased to the mid-80's. Chest x-ray was consistent with a left sided opacity throughout which was new.  She was transferred back to the Intensive Care Unit with ventilatory support and bronchoscopy was performed which revealed purulent drainage from the left mainstem, sample was sent.  Chest x-ray after bronchoscopy revealed markedly improved air space.  O2 saturations increased to 98% on only .4 FIO2.  Following this episode the patient was rested in IMV for several days.  At the time of this admission she was feeling better and feeling strong enough to try pressor support ventilation again. The teams thinking is that perhaps the patient needs to be rested each night in an MV mode letting her use only a trach mask for five days may have been to much to soon and in the future we will get her to tolerate pressor support and rest her on the night and possibly during the day allowing her to breath through the trach mask.  Currently she is being weaned, this will need to be continued at [**Hospital1 **]. Per discussion with the family the pulmonary attending is planning to call the pulmonary attending at [**Hospital1 **] to communicate the patient's need regarding ventilatory management. 3.  Infectious disease.  On [**10-16**] the patient's urine grew out Enterobacter which was sensitive only to Mirpenum and one other [**Doctor Last Name 360**].  She was treated with Mirpenum for seven days. At approximate completion of the 7 days course the patient's BAL sample from her bronch grew out pseudomonas which was resistant to Mirpenum.  Because of this switched to Zosyn which the pseudomonas was sensitive to.  She will be discharged on this and need to complete a 10 to 14 day course.  Additionally she was started on Flagyl for possible C. diff given that she was complaining of abdominal pain and was feeling extremely weak.  Of note, she did not have diarrhea.  She did seem to get better after starting the Flagyl so she will need to complete a 14 day course of this as well for empiric therapy for C. diff. Also of note the patient had one set of blood cultures positive for coag negative staph however, it was deemed that this was a contaminant and the decision was made not to treat after consultation with Infectious Disease service. 4.  Neurological.  The patient continued to show improvement in her strength while on 60 mg of Prednisone a day.  The original plan had been for her to be treated for 4 weeks with 60 mg of Prednisone empirically and then follow-up with the neuromuscular service for a decision as to whether or not to continue this.  However, after approximately 2-1/2 weeks of therapy the patient had issues with infectious disease as detailed above including urinary tract infection and pulmonary infection.  Because of these issues, with highly resistant bacteria it was deemed that the best thing to do would be to taper the steroids. On approximately [**10-22**] the patient was cut from 60 to 40 mg of Prednisone a day and on [**10-27**] the day of this dictation the patient was cut to 20 mg a day.  She will need to continue this slow taper until the steroids had been weaned to off. If her improvement in neurologic function continues even off the steroids then she can probably never start on steroids again however, if she shows a decline once she is off steroids this will further enforce the theory that the steroids are what has been treating her myopathy and once she is clear for infectious issues she should be restarted on steroids in the future.  She will follow-up with the neuromuscular service as detailed in her previous discharge summary. 5.  Psychiatric.  On one occasion the patient during the night the patient became quite despondent and request that she did not wish to continue with this therapy as she was incredibly frustrated.  However, the team had multiple discussions on their rounds and at the time of this dictation the patient's mood had significantly improved and her will to fight on actually seemed quite remarkable.  She is continued on her Paxil and at the present time the team did not see any need for additional psychiatric intervention. 6.  Communication.  A family meeting was held on [**2183-10-27**] with the patient's two daughters, son and husband as well as the attending physician in the Intensive Care Unit Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] the former Intensive Care Unit attending, myself Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 916**] and the patient's PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Discussion was held as to the patient's status.  We discussed the fact that the family had previously wished for the patient to have resolution of all her issues prior to going to rehabilitation.  However, we explained that her issues seemed to be taking quite sometime the resolve and that we will have to accept the fact that her issues are stable and improving although not completely resolved.  Additionally was discussed the fact that the patient was clearly ready for rehabilitation now and likely many of her problems including her pulmonary and gastrointestinal problems may benefit from getting her out of bed and having her go to rehabilitation. The family was open to this and grateful for our assistance. Tentative plans were made to arrange for discharge to [**Hospital1 5593**] on [**2183-10-29**]. An addendum to this discharge summary will be dictated following this detailing the events of the 15th and 16th. Please refer to that discharge summary for the exact meds at discharge and discharge diagnosis. DIAGNOSIS AT TIME OF THIS DICTATION: 1.  Respiratory failure resulting in ventilatory dependence. 2.

The mass is complex in its signal characteristics demonstrating peripheral irregular enhancement with central non-enhancement as well as peripheral slow diffusion. Tumor is felt most likely with central necrosis, although typically, central necrosis has homogeneous T2 hyperintensity centrally whereas this lesion demonstrates T2 isointensity. A complex hemorrhage is a possibility, although the CT obtained at outside institution demonstrates that this mass is not hyperdense, in a patient with anemia, it is possible that the density may be diminished. Possibly, both may be the case, a tumor with complex hemorrhage. Abscess is considered less likely given that centrally the lesion is hypointense on diffusion with peripheral slow diffusion. 2. Multifocal confluent and FLAIR hyperintensities are present within the periventricular and subcortical white matter without restricted diffusion or gradient signal artifact likely representing the sequela of chronic small vessel ischemic disease. C/A/P CT [**4-12**] - 1. Left upper lobe soft tissue mass with coarse calcification, associated traction bronchiectasis, and calcified hilar nodes. Additionally pleural calcification can be seen in prior asbestos exposure. There is underlying emphysema. These findings are worrisome for malignancy, though prior granulomatous infection might also have this appearance. Correlation with further studies (e.g. PET-CT, and/or biopsy) is recommended. 2. There is no evidence of malignancy of the abdomen or pelvis. Head Ct [**4-13**] - 1. Status post resection of a left parietal mass with expected post-surgical sequelae including pneumocephalus as well as some blood products within the surgical bed. 2. Layering pneumocephalus along the left frontal cerebral hemisphere with adjacent mass effect. 3. Ventricles appear more prominent on today's study compared to MRI of [**2103-4-12**], concerning for early ventriculomegaly. Recommend followup CT to monitor. 4. Extensive periventricular and subcortical white matter hypodensities, more prominent on the left versus the right are relatively unchanged since MRI Brain MRI [**4-14**] - 1. Status post resection of left parietooccipital mass with blood products at the surgical site without definite residual enhancement. Pneumocephalus is seen and expected post-surgical changes seen at the surgical site. 2. Linear area of restricted diffusion, extending deeper from the surgical site to the left periatrial region could represent an area of ischemia adjacent to the surgical site. Clinical correlation recommended. 3. Changes of small vessel disease and brain atrophy. No other enhancing brain lesions. Brief Hospital Course: Admitted to Neurosurgery for workup of new Left parietal lesion.  Coumadin and aspirin were held on admission.  MRI with and without Gadolinium revealed only the one solitary left parietal lesion and therefore the decision was made to resect the lesion.  Steroids were held for the possiblity of lymphoma.  Concern for metastatic prostate CA to the brain was low, however CT chest/Abd/Pelvis was performed for oncological workup. Chest/Abd/Pelv CT obtained on [**2103-4-12**] demonstrated a LUL mass with calcifications and b/l hilar adenopathy.  On [**2103-4-13**], patient underwent left-sided craniotomy and ressection of the left parietal mass. He was extubated without incident and transferred to SICU for management.  His ICU course was uneventful.  His post-operative CT and MRI showed post operative changes without evidence of new acute hemorrhage.  He was trasnferred to the floor in stable condition. During his course on the floor, patient had persistent hypertension. He was started on amlodipine 5mg with minimal response. Medicine was consulted for Hypertension management. Additionally, Thoracic surgery and neuro oncology were consulted regarding the LUL mass and brain mass, respectively.  He was transfered to the medicine service for further evaluation and management.  The remainder of his course was as follows: # Left parietal mass/left upper lung mass/likely new cancer diagnosis: Patient and wife aware that mass likely represents a cancer, most likely metastatic lung cancer, though not certain as pathology is pending at time of discharge.  Dexamethasone was tapered off.  Keppra was started for seizure prophylaxis and should be stopped 10 days following discharge.  Pathology of the mass will be followed-up as an outpatient.  Patient should follow-up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 724**] in neuro-oncology, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in thoracics, and medical oncology in the thoracic oncology clinic.  He will also need a PET/CT scan as an outpatient for further evaluation and staging of his disease.  Please see discharge paperwork regarding the appointments that need to be scheduled when he arrives at rehab.  Additionally, he will require PCP [**Name9 (PRE) 702**] on discharge from rehab. # Hypertension: BP was elevated post-op (160 and higher) and improved on amlodipine and tapering of the dexamethasone.  He was also continued on his home regimen of metoprolol, prazosin, and nitroglycerine patch.  BP was 110-130 on day of discharge. If blood pressure drops further, decrease amlodipine to 2.5 mg daily. # Urinary incontinence/retension and E. coli urinary tract infection: Patient has a history of urinary retension and incontince and straight caths himself multiple times per day (~[**4-27**]).  His urine culture grew >100K E. coli, pan-sensitive. He also had an elevated WBC count.  He was started on ceftriaxone on [**4-16**] and is being discharged on cefpodoxime.  He should have a total 14 day course for complicated UTI and will need 12 additional days on discharge.  Foley catheter was removed and regular straight cathing Q3-4 hours per home regimen was reinstated to reduce risk of reinfection and promote ambulation. # Atrial fibrillation: Stable.  Patient remained rate controlled on home regimen of amiodarone and metoprolol.  Warfarin was stopped due to craniotomy and can be restarted on [**2103-4-21**].  He should have his INR checked on [**4-24**] and every other day until his warfarin dose and INR are stabilized.  Goal INR is 2.0-3.0. # Coronary artery disease: Stable.  Metoprolol and statin continued.  Aspirin was held.  It should be restarted on [**2103-4-21**]. # Obstructive sleep apnea - Patient was continued on CPAP per home regimen. # Prostate cancer - Patient was continued on bicalutamide.  He also receives goserelin injections from his urologist. # Glaucoma - Continued timolol and lantanoprost eye drops # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, bowel regimen while on pain medications that should be weaned off. # Code: Full # Communication: Patient, HCP [**Name (NI) 3516**] [**Name (NI) 5598**] (wife) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5599**] On day of discharge, patient is afebrile and vital signs are stable.

You were also found to have a mass in the left upper lobe of your lung.  We have scheduled some specialist follow-up appointments for you and additional appointments still need to be scheduled.  These appointments are important to make sure that you receive prompt evaluation and treatment for your condition.  Please be sure to make and go to all appointments.

START Cefpodoxime 200 mg every 12 hours (for urinary tract infection) for 12 more days. START Amlodipine 5 mg daily for blood pressure.  If your blood pressure drops below 115 systolic, this medication can be stopped. START oxycodone 5 mg every 4 hours as needed for pain.  While you take this medication, STOP ultram.  As your pain gets better, you can stop the oxycodone and go back to ultram. START colace, senna, and miralax as needed to prevent constipation STOP Skelaxin.
