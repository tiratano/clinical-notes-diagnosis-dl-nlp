This woman has had a complicated medical course over the past six months which has included several episodes of respiratory failure, difficulty to wean off a ventilator, tracheostomy placement complicated by tracheal tear (requiring open sternotomy), anasarca, atrial fibrillation, E.coli sepsis, pseudomonas urinary tract infection, VRE intraabdominal abscess and Clostridium difficile colitis.  Her ventilatory difficulties were thought to be perhaps secondary to a myopathic process, although muscle biopsy results were inconclusive and not demonstrative of inflammatory changes. Patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 **] [**10-28**] through [**2183-12-18**] and successfully weaned from the ventilator there.  She was transferred to [**Hospital1 5595**] [**2183-12-18**] where she was gradually reintroduced to p.o. feed and weaned from PEG feeds.  She currently tolerates a pureed diet.  Her atrial fibrillation has been managed via rate control as the Amiodarone she was previous on was felt to possibly contribute to her myopathy.  She had been on Lasix (40 mg b.i.d.) on transfer from [**Hospital1 **] and nonetheless gained 12 pounds from [**12-28**] through [**1-15**].  Lasix was decreased to 20 mg q. day on [**1-12**] because her sodium was noted to be 129. On [**1-15**], the patient was noted to have increased dyspnea and tachypnea.  She states she has had intermittent dry cough for several days.  No subjective fevers or chills. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] today with still more dyspnea / tachypnea, sodium of 126 and a potassium of 6.2. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1.  Hypertension. 2.  Atrial fibrillation. 3.  Diastolic dysfunction (latest echo [**2183-9-30**] ejection fraction of 70 to 80% (2+ aortic regurgitation, moderate mitral regurgitation, moderate tricuspid regurgitation). 4.  History of intubations, tracheal tear secondary to tracheostomy, myopathic contribution to respiratory difficulty. 5.  E.coli sepsis. 6.  VRE abscess. 7.  Klebsiella pneumonia. 8.

Aspirin. 2.  Gentamycin. 3.  Vancomycin. SOCIAL HISTORY:  Twenty pack year smoking history.  Son, [**Name (NI) **], cardiologist in [**Location (un) 5583**]. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Positive for rash present since [**12-30**] at [**Hospital1 5595**]. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission temperature 97.4 F, heart rate 96, blood pressure 143/68, respirations 20 and oxygen saturation 88% on room air.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Pupils 2 mm, light reactive.  Sclerae anicteric. Oropharynx dry.  Lungs:  Bilateral end expiratory wheezes. Heart:  Regular rate, irregularly irregular rhythm, II/VI holosystolic murmur at the apex to the axilla.  Abdomen: Soft, mild diffuse tenderness, J tube site non-erythematous, positive bowel sounds.  Extremities:  2 cm bilateral pitting edema to mid thigh bilaterally.  Skin:  Reticular erythematous blanching and rash bilaterally upper extremities and trunk.  Neuro:  Alert and appropriately interactive. LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  White count 9.7, hematocrit 34.0, platelets 319.  INR 3.3, PTT 41.1.  Sodium 125, potassium 6.4, chloride 84, total CO2 31, BUN 25, creatinine 0.6, glucose 119. Arterial blood gas:  7.38 / 58 / 91. Chest x-ray:  Dense left retrocardiac opacity, small bilateral pleural effusions. HOSPITAL COURSE: 1.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient was admitted for treatment of pneumonia.  This was felt to be the main etiology of her respiratory distress.  She had a Levofloxacin allergy on my medical record, but per patient and daughter, she did not have an allergy.  She was placed on Levofloxacin 500 mg p.o. q. day for a 10 day course.  Her respiratory status subsequently improved and returned to her baseline level of saturating in the 90s on zero to two liters of oxygen per nasal cannula.  She was monitored for additional rash and no rash appeared.  Her previous rash symptomatically improved throughout admission. The patient had evidence of a urinary tract infection on urinalysis.  A culture was performed which was contaminated. Additional culture and sensitivities are recommended if the patient has continued symptoms despite her course of Levofloxacin. 2.  ELECTROLYTES:  Aforementioned, the patient had hyponatremia and hyperkalemia on admission.  She was noted to be extravascularly volume overloaded and intravascularly depleted by physical examination.  Potential etiologies of this were felt to include diastolic cardiac dysfunction and malnutrition with hypoalbuminemia.  The patient received one liter of normal saline at a slow rate.  Thereafter, she was fluid restricted.  Her sodium improved to a level of 129 on the day prior to discharge.  The patient's potassium likewise improved to a level under 5.  A cosyntropin stimulation test was performed to rule out adrenal insufficiency.  The test was negative. 3.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  Aforementioned, the patient was noted to be in atrial fibrillation and possibly with diastolic dysfunction.  Her Metoprolol was increased to 37.5 mg p.o. B.i.d. for improved rate control.  Her Captopril was also increased to 37.5 mg p.o. t.i.d.  She was continued on Digoxin as her son noted that the patient diuresis well in response to this drug.  She remained in atrial fibrillation with good rate control throughout admission. 4.  NUTRITION:  The patient has a recent history of malnutrition.  A nutrition consult was obtained for tube feed recommendations as the patient has had decreased p.o. intake of late.  She received nocturnal tube feedings with encouraged p.o. intake throughout the day.  It is recommended that her nutritional status be closely monitored at [**Hospital1 5595**] as this contributes to her general well-being. 5.  ENDOCRINE:  Patient has noted history of hypothyroidism. TSH was pending at time of this dictation.  She was continued on her outpatient dose of Synthroid throughout admission. 6.  PROPHYLAXIS:  The patient was continued on Coumadin at admission for her atrial fibrillation.  She had an elevated INR on day #1 of admission and her Coumadin was held.  It is recommended that her INR be monitored in an outpatient setting with adjustments made to maintain an INR between 2 and 3. 7.  PSYCH:  Patient has apparent depression with depressed mood and neurovegetative symptoms.  She was continued on Wellbutrin SR this admission.  It is recommended that she have a trial of Ritalin once she returns to [**Hospital1 5595**] for activation and appetite stimulation. DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: 1.  Pneumonia. 2.  Atrial fibrillation. 3.  Diastolic dysfunction. 4.  Depression. 5.  Malnutrition. 6.  Hypothyroidism. 7.  Retrosternal goiter. 8.  History of respiratory failure and multiple difficult intubations. 9.

The patient first developed black tarry stools two weeks ago prior to admission and an EGD at the time showed a small ulcer at the gastroesophageal junction.  She received 1 unit of packed red blood cells and was discharged in stable condition at that time. On [**2190-6-21**], three days prior to admission, she again developed black tarry stools.  She was scheduled to see Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5656**], her gastroenterologist, who performed an EGD on [**2190-6-23**], one day prior to admission.  This EGD showed a normal upper GI tract.  She was admitted to [**Hospital 1263**] Hospital the following day for a colonoscopy which only showed old blood in the cecum.  A repeat upper GI was done and showed two clots in the fundus with fresh blood.  She was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit at [**Hospital 1263**] Hospital, and then transferred to the [**Hospital1 188**] for possible angiography and embolization. At time of admission, she denied chest pain.  She had some mild shortness of breath especially when standing.  She did have dizziness when standing.  She also had five stools on the day of admission with her bowel prep.  She had one bowel movement prior to transfer.  She denied fever, cough, or hematemesis. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Nissen fundoplication in [**2173**] for severe gastroesophageal reflux disease. 2. Asthma. 3. Rheumatoid arthritis on Arava, methotrexate, and Enbrel. 4. Bilateral knee replacements in [**2186**]. 5. L5-S1 laminectomies. 6. Iron deficiency anemia. 7. Depression. 8. Status post splenectomy. MEDICATIONS AT HOME: 1. Arava 20 mg q day. 2. Methotrexate 25 mg q week. 3. Enbrel 25 mg 2x/week. 4. Prednisone 10 q day, which was discontinued in [**2190-2-16**]. 5. Prozac 20 q day. 6. Doxepin 100 q day. 7. Folate 2 q day. 8. Premarin 0.3 q day. 9. Medroxyprogesterone 2.75 q day. 10. Protonix 40 [**Hospital1 **]. ALLERGIES: 1. Penicillin which lead to wheezing and shortness of breath, and itching rash. 2. Sulfa which causes hives. FAMILY HISTORY:  Her maternal grandfather had a history of stomach cancer, and sister with severe gastroesophageal reflux disease.  Her father had gastroesophageal reflux disease. SOCIAL HISTORY:  She denies tobacco, alcohol, or IV drug use. She is a retired finance worker.  She is married with four children. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As noted above. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, she was afebrile with a temperature of 98.7, blood pressure was 103/54, with a heart rate of 100, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air.  In general, she was in no acute distress and pale appearing woman, who is obese.  Her head and neck examination:  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation. Extraocular motions were intact.  Her neck was supple with no lymphadenopathy.  Her heart was regular, rate, and rhythm with a systolic ejection murmur loudest at the left upper sternal border.  Her lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Abdomen was soft with no active bowel sounds, nontender, nondistended, and no hepatosplenomegaly.  Her extremities were warm and well perfused with no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema. LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  From outside hospital included a white count of 5.9, hematocrit of 27.7, platelets of 309,000. Her electrolytes were a sodium of 141, potassium of 4.6, chloride of 104, bicarbonate of 30, BUN 12, creatinine 0.6, glucose 121, calcium 8.4, phosphorus 2.6, magnesium 1.9.  Her coagulation panel included a PT of 12, INR of 1.1, PTT of 25.4. HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM: 1. Upper GI bleed:  The patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit upon admission, and was managed expectantly for any potential bleeding.  She was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells, and evaluated by the Gastroenterology Service.  They felt that she would benefit from another esophagogastroduodenoscopy prior to angiography to further evaluate the possible sources of bleeding.  She continued with stable vitals, and her EGD showed no active bleeding source or abnormality in the esophagus, stomach, or duodenum. She was continued on observation in the Medical Intensive Care Unit until her third hospital day, where it was felt that she was stable to return to the Medical floor.  In the following morning, however, she had a further episode of black stool as well as dizziness upon standing and tachycardia on standing.  She was thus, taken to the Angiography Vascular Interventional Suite, where a left gastric artery embolization was performed with gelfoam. Please see full report for details of the procedure.  The patient tolerated the procedure well with some residual nausea and vomiting, for which she was returned to the Medical Intensive Care Unit postoperatively for expectant management. The patient also had one episode of chest pain during the procedure that was evaluated with an electrocardiogram and one set of cardiac enzymes which were both negative for any evidence of ischemia.  It was felt that this was likely secondary to her gastroesophageal reflux disease from a horizontal position. On hospital day seven, the patient was again returned to the Medical floor after a stable time in the Intensive Care Unit. She had received 1 unit of packed red blood cells prior to and during the angiography procedure.  Her hematocrit following this transfusion was 35.2. For the remainder of her hospital stay, the hematocrit drifted slightly down to 33 with several small episodes of melena.  She was continually followed by the Gastroenterology Service with repeated hematocrits all remaining within the stable range.  Her dizziness and tachycardia upon standing resolved, and no further blood transfusions were necessary. Her nausea and vomiting resolved after her first day following the procedure, and no further evidence of bleed was noted.  Her diet was advanced slowly from clear liquids 48 hours after her embolization procedure, and she was advanced to soft solids followed by a regular diet on the day prior to discharge.  She remained pain free with stable vitals and no further evidence of bleed on hospital day 11, the day of her discharge. 2. Shortness of breath and hypoxia:  The patient reported shortness of breath and hypoxia, that was thought to be secondary to her anemia and deconditioning with decreased activity over the prior months.  However, given the patient's changes in volume with transfusions as well as her lower extremity edema and presence of murmur, an echocardiogram was obtained which showed normal left ventricular function and ejection fraction as well as no evidence of diastolic dysfunction.  Please see full report for details of the study. In addition, given her hospitalizations and partial compliance with Venodynes sequential compression device boots, it was felt that a pulmonary embolism was also a possible cause for her shortness of breath.  A CT angiogram was obtained, and no evidence of pulmonary embolism was found.  The patient remained on oxygen 2 liters nasal cannula during her early hospitalization, however, on the final three days of her hospitalization, she was oxygenating 94% on room air range.  She was also able to ambulate without shortness of breath or desaturation.  It was felt that her hypoxia was possibly secondary to her history of asthma/reactive airways disease.  Further workup as an outpatient is recommended as needed. 3. Rheumatoid arthritis:  The patient's rheumatoid arthritis medicines were held during this initial acute episode.  She remained without pain or flare of her rheumatoid arthritis, however, on the final hospital day, she complained of some mild joint symptoms in her hands.  It was recommended that she resume her rheumatoid arthritis medicines under consultation of her primary doctor. 4. Depression and anxiety:  The patient was maintained on her regimen of Prozac and doxepin as well as receiving Ativan prn and at hs. 5. Fever:  The patient had one episode of fever following her GI embolization.  This was felt to be secondary to postoperative response to foreign material within the vasculature.  Her right groin sites where the interventional catheters were placed showed no signs of infection.  In addition, her lungs were clear and no urinary symptoms were identified.  She persisted with some mild low-grade fevers for two days following the procedure, however, the temperature came down to within her normal range subsequently.  No sign of infection was noted, and blood cultures were not sent. On hospital day 11, the patient was deemed in stable condition to return home. CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good and stable. DISCHARGE STATUS:  Home with no services. DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: 1. Gastrointestinal bleed. 2. Rheumatoid arthritis. 3. Anxiety/depression. 4. Blood loss anemia. 5. Hypovolemia. 6. Hypoxia. DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1. Arava 20 mg q day. 2. Methotrexate 25 mg q week. 3. Enbrel 25 mg 2x/week. 4. Prednisone 10 q day, which was discontinued in [**2190-2-16**]. 5. Prozac 20 q day. 6. Doxepin 100 q day. 7. Folate 2 q day. 8. Premarin 0.3 q day. 9. Medroxyprogesterone 2.75 q day. 10. Protonix 40 [**Hospital1 **]. 11. Omeprazole 40 mg po bid. FOLLOW-UP PLANS:  The patient is instructed to followup with her gastroenterologist, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 5656**].  Is instructed to return to the Emergency Department or contact her physician if she develops any further bleeding per rectum, dark tarry stools, or fevers, nausea is uncontrolled, or vomiting.

He presented to an outside hospital Emergency Department about 3:00 in the afternoon and was found to have elevated ST segments.  He was started on Integrilin at that time and was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for emergency cardiac catheterization.  This revealed left main and severe three vessel coronary artery disease with a left ventricular ejection fraction of greater than 55 percent and was referred for emergency coronary artery bypass grafting. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for nephrolithiasis status post stone extraction as well as ankle surgery. PREOPERATIVE MEDICATIONS:  Accupril, Metoprolol 100 mg po bid, Lipitor 20 mg po q d, Vitamin E, and Aspirin daily. ALLERGIES:  The patient states no known drug allergies although he does note an upset stomach with erythromycin. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Upon admission to the hospital was unremarkable as were his laboratory values with the exception of elevated CPKs and Troponins. HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken emergently to the Operating Room due to his findings in catheterization laboratory of a 95 percent left main coronary artery stenosis, as well as a 90 percent to 95 percent left anterior descending coronary artery lesion.  80 percent proximal left circumflex and an occluded right coronary artery.  The patient was taken to the Operating Room with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 70**] where he underwent coronary artery bypass graft times three.  The patient had an intraaortic balloon pump placed preoperatively due to his anatomy.  Postoperatively he was transported from the Operating Room to Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit in good condition on Propofol and Phenylephrine drips. On postoperative day #1, he was weaned from mechanical ventilation, successfully extubated.  He remains on Neo- Synephrine for the next day or so due to some hypotension, his cardiac function remained good with a cardiac index of greater than 3.  His intraaortic balloon pump was weaned and subsequently discontinued on postoperative day #1.  The patient did require some intravenous fluid boluses for hypotension. On postoperative day #2, the patient had some atrial fibrillation and was placed on Amiodarone because of this. He was also begun on Lopressor at that time and begun with diuresis. The following day the patient had converted back to normal sinus rhythm.  Had remained hemodynamically stable.  Had his Neo-Synephrine drip weaned to off and was tolerating beta blocker and diuresis. Postoperative day #3, he was transferred from the intensive care unit to the telemetry floor.  His Metoprolol had been increased.  His [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain in his leg had been removed and he had begun ambulation and cardiac rehabilitation.  The patient subsequently on the telemetry floor had another episode of atrial fibrillation that was short lived on [**2164-7-10**], early in the morning that was self limiting.  His Lopressor was increased and he has not had any further episodes of atrial fibrillation.  He remains on Amiodarone and Metoprolol for this. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Today, [**2164-7-11**], is as follows: The patient is afebrile.  He is in normal sinus rhythm with a rate in the mid 70's.  His blood pressure is 120/74.  Room air oxygen saturation is 96 percent.  Neurologically he is grossly intact with no apparent deficits.  His pulmonary examination - his lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Coronary examination is regular rate and rhythm.  His abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended.  His extremities are warm without edema.  His sternal incision as well as his right leg incisions are all clean and dry with no erythema, no drainage.  The Steri-strips are intact. DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Lopressor 100 mg po bid, Lasix 20 mg po bid times seven days, Potassium Chloride 20 mEq po bid times seven days, Zantac 150 mg po bid, Aspirin 325 mg po q d, Plavix 75 mg po q d times three months.  Lipitor 20 mg po q d, Percocet 5/325 po q four hours prn pain.  The patient is also to continue on Amiodarone 400 mg po tid times one week, then decrease to 400 mg po bid times one week, then decrease 400 mg po q d times one week, and then decrease to 200 mg po q d for the remaining week.  This is the tentative plan for Amiodarone loading unless it is altered or until it is discontinued by the patient's primary cardiologist, Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 122**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].  The patient is also going home with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of Hearts cardiac monitor for his Amiodarone loading and this will be transmitted to the electrophysiology service here at [**Hospital1 69**].
