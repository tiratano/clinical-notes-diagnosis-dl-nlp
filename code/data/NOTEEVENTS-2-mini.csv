776,20007,188442,"2183-10-29 00:00:00","Discharge summary","Report",,"","Admission Date:  [**2183-9-25**]       Discharge Date: [**2183-10-29**] Service: HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The following discharge summary will cover the time period from [**10-15**] through [**2183-10-28**]. Please see previous discharge summary for information on patient's admission diagnosis and medications. HOSPITAL COURSE: 1.  Gastrointestinal.  On [**10-16**] the patient developed nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain.  Because of this she was not discharged to rehabilitation at [**Location (un) 511**] Center Hospital as had been previously planned.  Due to her symptoms a CT scan was obtained which revealed the patient had an ileus. There were no abscesses or other processes that could be identified.  The neurology service was consulted regarding possibility of this ileus being related to the patient's myopathy but felt this was unlikely since skeletal muscle myopathies typically do not also involve smooth muscle of the Gastrointestinal tract.  A Gastrointestinal consult was obtained who had no additional thoughts on what could be causing the patient's ileus and recommended bowel rest. The patient was kept off tube feeds for two days after which time they were restarted at a low rate of 20 cc's an hour as compared to her goal rate of 65 cc's per hour.  The patient appeared to tolerate this reasonably well and the tube feeds were increased.  When they reached the rate of 30 cc's an hour however the patient developed nausea and vomiting a second time.  Tube feeds were again stopped and her bowel was rested for several days. On [**10-24**] it was decided that because the patient was unable to tolerate tube feeds at a reasonable rate she would be started on TPN for nutrition.  At the time of this dictation on [**10-27**] the patient was reporting decreased abdominal pain and no further nausea or vomiting.  She additionally had been successful in moving her bowels and treated with Colace, Senokot and Fleet enemas.  The suspicion of the team at this point in time is that her ileus is resolving however, very slowly.  Her tube feeds will need to be started at a very slow rate, advanced extremely gently as tolerated with caution being taken because when the rate is increased to abruptly she does tend to develop nausea and vomiting.  She will be discharged out on no tube feeds, they can be started when she arrives at [**Location (un) 511**] Center for rehabilitation. She will be discharged out on TPN which she can continue. Additionally we will maintain her on [**Doctor Last Name **] and Colace. 2.  Pulmonary.  The patient continued to do well on a trach mask and in fact tolerated trach mask ventilation for five days in a row with no support from mechanical ventilator. Because of this she was deemed safe to go to the floor something which the team and the patient's family were very happy with as it was thought this could be a trial preliminary to transferring her to rehabilitation home.  On [**10-21**] she was transferred to the floor. Unfortunately however, on [**10-22**] she was found to be hypoxic to the low 80's on the floor.  She was suctioned with thick tenacious dark secretions came out, her O2 sats increased to the mid-80's. Chest x-ray was consistent with a left sided opacity throughout which was new.  She was transferred back to the Intensive Care Unit with ventilatory support and bronchoscopy was performed which revealed purulent drainage from the left mainstem, sample was sent.  Chest x-ray after bronchoscopy revealed markedly improved air space.  O2 saturations increased to 98% on only .4 FIO2.  Following this episode the patient was rested in IMV for several days.  At the time of this admission she was feeling better and feeling strong enough to try pressor support ventilation again. The teams thinking is that perhaps the patient needs to be rested each night in an MV mode letting her use only a trach mask for five days may have been to much to soon and in the future we will get her to tolerate pressor support and rest her on the night and possibly during the day allowing her to breath through the trach mask.  Currently she is being weaned, this will need to be continued at [**Hospital1 **]. Per discussion with the family the pulmonary attending is planning to call the pulmonary attending at [**Hospital1 **] to communicate the patient's need regarding ventilatory management. 3.  Infectious disease.  On [**10-16**] the patient's urine grew out Enterobacter which was sensitive only to Mirpenum and one other [**Doctor Last Name 360**].  She was treated with Mirpenum for seven days. At approximate completion of the 7 days course the patient's BAL sample from her bronch grew out pseudomonas which was resistant to Mirpenum.  Because of this switched to Zosyn which the pseudomonas was sensitive to.  She will be discharged on this and need to complete a 10 to 14 day course.  Additionally she was started on Flagyl for possible C. diff given that she was complaining of abdominal pain and was feeling extremely weak.  Of note, she did not have diarrhea.  She did seem to get better after starting the Flagyl so she will need to complete a 14 day course of this as well for empiric therapy for C. diff. Also of note the patient had one set of blood cultures positive for coag negative staph however, it was deemed that this was a contaminant and the decision was made not to treat after consultation with Infectious Disease service. 4.  Neurological.  The patient continued to show improvement in her strength while on 60 mg of Prednisone a day.  The original plan had been for her to be treated for 4 weeks with 60 mg of Prednisone empirically and then follow-up with the neuromuscular service for a decision as to whether or not to continue this.  However, after approximately 2-1/2 weeks of therapy the patient had issues with infectious disease as detailed above including urinary tract infection and pulmonary infection.  Because of these issues, with highly resistant bacteria it was deemed that the best thing to do would be to taper the steroids. On approximately [**10-22**] the patient was cut from 60 to 40 mg of Prednisone a day and on [**10-27**] the day of this dictation the patient was cut to 20 mg a day.  She will need to continue this slow taper until the steroids had been weaned to off. If her improvement in neurologic function continues even off the steroids then she can probably never start on steroids again however, if she shows a decline once she is off steroids this will further enforce the theory that the steroids are what has been treating her myopathy and once she is clear for infectious issues she should be restarted on steroids in the future.  She will follow-up with the neuromuscular service as detailed in her previous discharge summary. 5.  Psychiatric.  On one occasion the patient during the night the patient became quite despondent and request that she did not wish to continue with this therapy as she was incredibly frustrated.  However, the team had multiple discussions on their rounds and at the time of this dictation the patient's mood had significantly improved and her will to fight on actually seemed quite remarkable.  She is continued on her Paxil and at the present time the team did not see any need for additional psychiatric intervention. 6.  Communication.  A family meeting was held on [**2183-10-27**] with the patient's two daughters, son and husband as well as the attending physician in the Intensive Care Unit Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] the former Intensive Care Unit attending, myself Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 916**] and the patient's PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Discussion was held as to the patient's status.  We discussed the fact that the family had previously wished for the patient to have resolution of all her issues prior to going to rehabilitation.  However, we explained that her issues seemed to be taking quite sometime the resolve and that we will have to accept the fact that her issues are stable and improving although not completely resolved.  Additionally was discussed the fact that the patient was clearly ready for rehabilitation now and likely many of her problems including her pulmonary and gastrointestinal problems may benefit from getting her out of bed and having her go to rehabilitation. The family was open to this and grateful for our assistance. Tentative plans were made to arrange for discharge to [**Hospital1 5593**] on [**2183-10-29**]. An addendum to this discharge summary will be dictated following this detailing the events of the 15th and 16th. Please refer to that discharge summary for the exact meds at discharge and discharge diagnosis. DIAGNOSIS AT TIME OF THIS DICTATION: 1.  Respiratory failure resulting in ventilatory dependence. 2.

777,20007,193793,"2184-01-20 00:00:00","Discharge summary","Report",,"","Admission Date:  [**2184-1-16**]       Discharge Date:  [**2184-1-20**] Service:  [**Hospital1 212**] HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 79-year-old woman is admitted for respiratory distress, hyponatremia and hyperkalemia.  This woman has had a complicated medical course over the past six months which has included several episodes of respiratory failure, difficulty to wean off a ventilator, tracheostomy placement complicated by tracheal tear (requiring open sternotomy), anasarca, atrial fibrillation, E.coli sepsis, pseudomonas urinary tract infection, VRE intraabdominal abscess and Clostridium difficile colitis.  Her ventilatory difficulties were thought to be perhaps secondary to a myopathic process, although muscle biopsy results were inconclusive and not demonstrative of inflammatory changes. Patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 **] [**10-28**] through [**2183-12-18**] and successfully weaned from the ventilator there.  She was transferred to [**Hospital1 5595**] [**2183-12-18**] where she was gradually reintroduced to p.o. feed and weaned from PEG feeds.  She currently tolerates a pureed diet.  Her atrial fibrillation has been managed via rate control as the Amiodarone she was previous on was felt to possibly contribute to her myopathy.  She had been on Lasix (40 mg b.i.d.) on transfer from [**Hospital1 **] and nonetheless gained 12 pounds from [**12-28**] through [**1-15**].  Lasix was decreased to 20 mg q. day on [**1-12**] because her sodium was noted to be 129. On [**1-15**], the patient was noted to have increased dyspnea and tachypnea.  She states she has had intermittent dry cough for several days.  No subjective fevers or chills. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] today with still more dyspnea / tachypnea, sodium of 126 and a potassium of 6.2. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1.  Hypertension. 2.  Atrial fibrillation. 3.  Diastolic dysfunction (latest echo [**2183-9-30**] ejection fraction of 70 to 80% (2+ aortic regurgitation, moderate mitral regurgitation, moderate tricuspid regurgitation). 4.  History of intubations, tracheal tear secondary to tracheostomy, myopathic contribution to respiratory difficulty. 5.  E.coli sepsis. 6.  VRE abscess. 7.  Klebsiella pneumonia. 8.

Aspirin. 2.  Gentamycin. 3.  Vancomycin. SOCIAL HISTORY:  Twenty pack year smoking history.  Son, [**Name (NI) **], cardiologist in [**Location (un) 5583**]. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Positive for rash present since [**12-30**] at [**Hospital1 5595**]. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission temperature 97.4 F, heart rate 96, blood pressure 143/68, respirations 20 and oxygen saturation 88% on room air.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Pupils 2 mm, light reactive.  Sclerae anicteric. Oropharynx dry.  Lungs:  Bilateral end expiratory wheezes. Heart:  Regular rate, irregularly irregular rhythm, II/VI holosystolic murmur at the apex to the axilla.  Abdomen: Soft, mild diffuse tenderness, J tube site non-erythematous, positive bowel sounds.  Extremities:  2 cm bilateral pitting edema to mid thigh bilaterally.  Skin:  Reticular erythematous blanching and rash bilaterally upper extremities and trunk.  Neuro:  Alert and appropriately interactive. LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  White count 9.7, hematocrit 34.0, platelets 319.  INR 3.3, PTT 41.1.  Sodium 125, potassium 6.4, chloride 84, total CO2 31, BUN 25, creatinine 0.6, glucose 119. Arterial blood gas:  7.38 / 58 / 91. Chest x-ray:  Dense left retrocardiac opacity, small bilateral pleural effusions. HOSPITAL COURSE: 1.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient was admitted for treatment of pneumonia.  This was felt to be the main etiology of her respiratory distress.  She had a Levofloxacin allergy on my medical record, but per patient and daughter, she did not have an allergy.  She was placed on Levofloxacin 500 mg p.o. q. day for a 10 day course.  Her respiratory status subsequently improved and returned to her baseline level of saturating in the 90s on zero to two liters of oxygen per nasal cannula.  She was monitored for additional rash and no rash appeared.  Her previous rash symptomatically improved throughout admission. The patient had evidence of a urinary tract infection on urinalysis.  A culture was performed which was contaminated. Additional culture and sensitivities are recommended if the patient has continued symptoms despite her course of Levofloxacin. 2.  ELECTROLYTES:  Aforementioned, the patient had hyponatremia and hyperkalemia on admission.  She was noted to be extravascularly volume overloaded and intravascularly depleted by physical examination.  Potential etiologies of this were felt to include diastolic cardiac dysfunction and malnutrition with hypoalbuminemia.  The patient received one liter of normal saline at a slow rate.  Thereafter, she was fluid restricted.  Her sodium improved to a level of 129 on the day prior to discharge.  The patient's potassium likewise improved to a level under 5.  A cosyntropin stimulation test was performed to rule out adrenal insufficiency.  The test was negative. 3.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  Aforementioned, the patient was noted to be in atrial fibrillation and possibly with diastolic dysfunction.  Her Metoprolol was increased to 37.5 mg p.o. B.i.d. for improved rate control.  Her Captopril was also increased to 37.5 mg p.o. t.i.d.  She was continued on Digoxin as her son noted that the patient diuresis well in response to this drug.  She remained in atrial fibrillation with good rate control throughout admission. 4.  NUTRITION:  The patient has a recent history of malnutrition.  A nutrition consult was obtained for tube feed recommendations as the patient has had decreased p.o. intake of late.  She received nocturnal tube feedings with encouraged p.o. intake throughout the day.  It is recommended that her nutritional status be closely monitored at [**Hospital1 5595**] as this contributes to her general well-being. 5.  ENDOCRINE:  Patient has noted history of hypothyroidism. TSH was pending at time of this dictation.  She was continued on her outpatient dose of Synthroid throughout admission. 6.  PROPHYLAXIS:  The patient was continued on Coumadin at admission for her atrial fibrillation.  She had an elevated INR on day #1 of admission and her Coumadin was held.  It is recommended that her INR be monitored in an outpatient setting with adjustments made to maintain an INR between 2 and 3. 7.  PSYCH:  Patient has apparent depression with depressed mood and neurovegetative symptoms.  She was continued on Wellbutrin SR this admission.  It is recommended that she have a trial of Ritalin once she returns to [**Hospital1 5595**] for activation and appetite stimulation. DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: 1.  Pneumonia. 2.  Atrial fibrillation. 3.  Diastolic dysfunction. 4.  Depression. 5.  Malnutrition. 6.  Hypothyroidism. 7.  Retrosternal goiter. 8.  History of respiratory failure and multiple difficult intubations. 9.

The mass is complex in its signal characteristics demonstrating peripheral irregular enhancement with central non-enhancement as well as peripheral slow diffusion. Tumor is felt most likely with central necrosis, although typically, central necrosis has homogeneous T2 hyperintensity centrally whereas this lesion demonstrates T2 isointensity. A complex hemorrhage is a possibility, although the CT obtained at outside institution demonstrates that this mass is not hyperdense, in a patient with anemia, it is possible that the density may be diminished. Possibly, both may be the case, a tumor with complex hemorrhage. Abscess is considered less likely given that centrally the lesion is hypointense on diffusion with peripheral slow diffusion. 2. Multifocal confluent and FLAIR hyperintensities are present within the periventricular and subcortical white matter without restricted diffusion or gradient signal artifact likely representing the sequela of chronic small vessel ischemic disease. C/A/P CT [**4-12**] - 1. Left upper lobe soft tissue mass with coarse calcification, associated traction bronchiectasis, and calcified hilar nodes. Additionally pleural calcification can be seen in prior asbestos exposure. There is underlying emphysema. These findings are worrisome for malignancy, though prior granulomatous infection might also have this appearance. Correlation with further studies (e.g. PET-CT, and/or biopsy) is recommended. 2. There is no evidence of malignancy of the abdomen or pelvis. Head Ct [**4-13**] - 1. Status post resection of a left parietal mass with expected post-surgical sequelae including pneumocephalus as well as some blood products within the surgical bed. 2. Layering pneumocephalus along the left frontal cerebral hemisphere with adjacent mass effect. 3. Ventricles appear more prominent on today's study compared to MRI of [**2103-4-12**], concerning for early ventriculomegaly. Recommend followup CT to monitor. 4. Extensive periventricular and subcortical white matter hypodensities, more prominent on the left versus the right are relatively unchanged since MRI Brain MRI [**4-14**] - 1. Status post resection of left parietooccipital mass with blood products at the surgical site without definite residual enhancement. Pneumocephalus is seen and expected post-surgical changes seen at the surgical site. 2. Linear area of restricted diffusion, extending deeper from the surgical site to the left periatrial region could represent an area of ischemia adjacent to the surgical site. Clinical correlation recommended. 3. Changes of small vessel disease and brain atrophy. No other enhancing brain lesions. Brief Hospital Course: Admitted to Neurosurgery for workup of new Left parietal lesion.  Coumadin and aspirin were held on admission.  MRI with and without Gadolinium revealed only the one solitary left parietal lesion and therefore the decision was made to resect the lesion.  Steroids were held for the possiblity of lymphoma.  Concern for metastatic prostate CA to the brain was low, however CT chest/Abd/Pelvis was performed for oncological workup. Chest/Abd/Pelv CT obtained on [**2103-4-12**] demonstrated a LUL mass with calcifications and b/l hilar adenopathy.  On [**2103-4-13**], patient underwent left-sided craniotomy and ressection of the left parietal mass. He was extubated without incident and transferred to SICU for management.  His ICU course was uneventful.  His post-operative CT and MRI showed post operative changes without evidence of new acute hemorrhage.  He was trasnferred to the floor in stable condition. During his course on the floor, patient had persistent hypertension. He was started on amlodipine 5mg with minimal response. Medicine was consulted for Hypertension management. Additionally, Thoracic surgery and neuro oncology were consulted regarding the LUL mass and brain mass, respectively.  He was transfered to the medicine service for further evaluation and management.  The remainder of his course was as follows: # Left parietal mass/left upper lung mass/likely new cancer diagnosis: Patient and wife aware that mass likely represents a cancer, most likely metastatic lung cancer, though not certain as pathology is pending at time of discharge.  Dexamethasone was tapered off.  Keppra was started for seizure prophylaxis and should be stopped 10 days following discharge.  Pathology of the mass will be followed-up as an outpatient.  Patient should follow-up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 724**] in neuro-oncology, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in thoracics, and medical oncology in the thoracic oncology clinic.  He will also need a PET/CT scan as an outpatient for further evaluation and staging of his disease.  Please see discharge paperwork regarding the appointments that need to be scheduled when he arrives at rehab.  Additionally, he will require PCP [**Name9 (PRE) 702**] on discharge from rehab. # Hypertension: BP was elevated post-op (160 and higher) and improved on amlodipine and tapering of the dexamethasone.  He was also continued on his home regimen of metoprolol, prazosin, and nitroglycerine patch.  BP was 110-130 on day of discharge. If blood pressure drops further, decrease amlodipine to 2.5 mg daily. # Urinary incontinence/retension and E. coli urinary tract infection: Patient has a history of urinary retension and incontince and straight caths himself multiple times per day (~[**4-27**]).  His urine culture grew >100K E. coli, pan-sensitive. He also had an elevated WBC count.  He was started on ceftriaxone on [**4-16**] and is being discharged on cefpodoxime.  He should have a total 14 day course for complicated UTI and will need 12 additional days on discharge.  Foley catheter was removed and regular straight cathing Q3-4 hours per home regimen was reinstated to reduce risk of reinfection and promote ambulation. # Atrial fibrillation: Stable.  Patient remained rate controlled on home regimen of amiodarone and metoprolol.  Warfarin was stopped due to craniotomy and can be restarted on [**2103-4-21**].  He should have his INR checked on [**4-24**] and every other day until his warfarin dose and INR are stabilized.  Goal INR is 2.0-3.0. # Coronary artery disease: Stable.  Metoprolol and statin continued.  Aspirin was held.  It should be restarted on [**2103-4-21**]. # Obstructive sleep apnea - Patient was continued on CPAP per home regimen. # Prostate cancer - Patient was continued on bicalutamide.  He also receives goserelin injections from his urologist. # Glaucoma - Continued timolol and lantanoprost eye drops # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, bowel regimen while on pain medications that should be weaned off. # Code: Full # Communication: Patient, HCP [**Name (NI) 3516**] [**Name (NI) 5598**] (wife) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5599**] On day of discharge, patient is afebrile and vital signs are stable.

Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive. Activity Status: Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker or cane). Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital following a fall and found to have a mass in your brain.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], your neurosurgeon, removed this mass and the pathology to determine exactly what it is, is still pending, though it is most likely some form of cancer.  You were also found to have a mass in the left upper lobe of your lung.  We have scheduled some specialist follow-up appointments for you and additional appointments still need to be scheduled.  These appointments are important to make sure that you receive prompt evaluation and treatment for your condition.  Please be sure to make and go to all appointments. The following changes were made to your medications: START Keppra 500 mg twice a day (for seizure prophylaxis).  You should stop this medication 10 days after you leave the hospital. START Cefpodoxime 200 mg every 12 hours (for urinary tract infection) for 12 more days. START Amlodipine 5 mg daily for blood pressure.  If your blood pressure drops below 115 systolic, this medication can be stopped. START oxycodone 5 mg every 4 hours as needed for pain.  While you take this medication, STOP ultram.  As your pain gets better, you can stop the oxycodone and go back to ultram. START colace, senna, and miralax as needed to prevent constipation STOP Skelaxin.  You seemed to do okay without this medication. START heparin for clot prophylaxis until your INR is therapeutic or you are moving enough at rehab to prevent clots. You can RESTART your aspirin and warfarin on [**2103-4-21**].  Please get your INR checked on the 4th day thereafter and at least every other day until your INR and warfarin dose are stable. Goal INR is 2.0-3.0. Additional instructions from your neurosurgeons are below: General Instructions ??????	Have a friend/family member check your incision daily for signs of infection. ??????

Protonix 40 [**Hospital1 **]. ALLERGIES: 1. Penicillin which lead to wheezing and shortness of breath, and itching rash. 2. Sulfa which causes hives. FAMILY HISTORY:  Her maternal grandfather had a history of stomach cancer, and sister with severe gastroesophageal reflux disease.  Her father had gastroesophageal reflux disease. SOCIAL HISTORY:  She denies tobacco, alcohol, or IV drug use. She is a retired finance worker.  She is married with four children. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As noted above. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, she was afebrile with a temperature of 98.7, blood pressure was 103/54, with a heart rate of 100, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air.  In general, she was in no acute distress and pale appearing woman, who is obese.  Her head and neck examination:  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation. Extraocular motions were intact.  Her neck was supple with no lymphadenopathy.  Her heart was regular, rate, and rhythm with a systolic ejection murmur loudest at the left upper sternal border.  Her lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Abdomen was soft with no active bowel sounds, nontender, nondistended, and no hepatosplenomegaly.  Her extremities were warm and well perfused with no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema. LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  From outside hospital included a white count of 5.9, hematocrit of 27.7, platelets of 309,000. Her electrolytes were a sodium of 141, potassium of 4.6, chloride of 104, bicarbonate of 30, BUN 12, creatinine 0.6, glucose 121, calcium 8.4, phosphorus 2.6, magnesium 1.9.  Her coagulation panel included a PT of 12, INR of 1.1, PTT of 25.4. HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM: 1. Upper GI bleed:  The patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit upon admission, and was managed expectantly for any potential bleeding.  She was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells, and evaluated by the Gastroenterology Service.  They felt that she would benefit from another esophagogastroduodenoscopy prior to angiography to further evaluate the possible sources of bleeding.  She continued with stable vitals, and her EGD showed no active bleeding source or abnormality in the esophagus, stomach, or duodenum. She was continued on observation in the Medical Intensive Care Unit until her third hospital day, where it was felt that she was stable to return to the Medical floor.  In the following morning, however, she had a further episode of black stool as well as dizziness upon standing and tachycardia on standing.  She was thus, taken to the Angiography Vascular Interventional Suite, where a left gastric artery embolization was performed with gelfoam. Please see full report for details of the procedure.  The patient tolerated the procedure well with some residual nausea and vomiting, for which she was returned to the Medical Intensive Care Unit postoperatively for expectant management. The patient also had one episode of chest pain during the procedure that was evaluated with an electrocardiogram and one set of cardiac enzymes which were both negative for any evidence of ischemia.  It was felt that this was likely secondary to her gastroesophageal reflux disease from a horizontal position. On hospital day seven, the patient was again returned to the Medical floor after a stable time in the Intensive Care Unit. She had received 1 unit of packed red blood cells prior to and during the angiography procedure.  Her hematocrit following this transfusion was 35.2. For the remainder of her hospital stay, the hematocrit drifted slightly down to 33 with several small episodes of melena.  She was continually followed by the Gastroenterology Service with repeated hematocrits all remaining within the stable range.  Her dizziness and tachycardia upon standing resolved, and no further blood transfusions were necessary. Her nausea and vomiting resolved after her first day following the procedure, and no further evidence of bleed was noted.  Her diet was advanced slowly from clear liquids 48 hours after her embolization procedure, and she was advanced to soft solids followed by a regular diet on the day prior to discharge.  She remained pain free with stable vitals and no further evidence of bleed on hospital day 11, the day of her discharge. 2. Shortness of breath and hypoxia:  The patient reported shortness of breath and hypoxia, that was thought to be secondary to her anemia and deconditioning with decreased activity over the prior months.  However, given the patient's changes in volume with transfusions as well as her lower extremity edema and presence of murmur, an echocardiogram was obtained which showed normal left ventricular function and ejection fraction as well as no evidence of diastolic dysfunction.  Please see full report for details of the study. In addition, given her hospitalizations and partial compliance with Venodynes sequential compression device boots, it was felt that a pulmonary embolism was also a possible cause for her shortness of breath.  A CT angiogram was obtained, and no evidence of pulmonary embolism was found.  The patient remained on oxygen 2 liters nasal cannula during her early hospitalization, however, on the final three days of her hospitalization, she was oxygenating 94% on room air range.  She was also able to ambulate without shortness of breath or desaturation.  It was felt that her hypoxia was possibly secondary to her history of asthma/reactive airways disease.  Further workup as an outpatient is recommended as needed. 3. Rheumatoid arthritis:  The patient's rheumatoid arthritis medicines were held during this initial acute episode.  She remained without pain or flare of her rheumatoid arthritis, however, on the final hospital day, she complained of some mild joint symptoms in her hands.  It was recommended that she resume her rheumatoid arthritis medicines under consultation of her primary doctor. 4. Depression and anxiety:  The patient was maintained on her regimen of Prozac and doxepin as well as receiving Ativan prn and at hs. 5. Fever:  The patient had one episode of fever following her GI embolization.  This was felt to be secondary to postoperative response to foreign material within the vasculature.  Her right groin sites where the interventional catheters were placed showed no signs of infection.  In addition, her lungs were clear and no urinary symptoms were identified.  She persisted with some mild low-grade fevers for two days following the procedure, however, the temperature came down to within her normal range subsequently.  No sign of infection was noted, and blood cultures were not sent. On hospital day 11, the patient was deemed in stable condition to return home. CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good and stable. DISCHARGE STATUS:  Home with no services. DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: 1. Gastrointestinal bleed. 2. Rheumatoid arthritis. 3. Anxiety/depression. 4. Blood loss anemia. 5. Hypovolemia. 6. Hypoxia.

He presented to an outside hospital Emergency Department about 3:00 in the afternoon and was found to have elevated ST segments.  He was started on Integrilin at that time and was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for emergency cardiac catheterization.  This revealed left main and severe three vessel coronary artery disease with a left ventricular ejection fraction of greater than 55 percent and was referred for emergency coronary artery bypass grafting. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for nephrolithiasis status post stone extraction as well as ankle surgery. PREOPERATIVE MEDICATIONS:  Accupril, Metoprolol 100 mg po bid, Lipitor 20 mg po q d, Vitamin E, and Aspirin daily. ALLERGIES:  The patient states no known drug allergies although he does note an upset stomach with erythromycin. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Upon admission to the hospital was unremarkable as were his laboratory values with the exception of elevated CPKs and Troponins. HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken emergently to the Operating Room due to his findings in catheterization laboratory of a 95 percent left main coronary artery stenosis, as well as a 90 percent to 95 percent left anterior descending coronary artery lesion.  80 percent proximal left circumflex and an occluded right coronary artery.  The patient was taken to the Operating Room with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 70**] where he underwent coronary artery bypass graft times three.  The patient had an intraaortic balloon pump placed preoperatively due to his anatomy.  Postoperatively he was transported from the Operating Room to Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit in good condition on Propofol and Phenylephrine drips. On postoperative day #1, he was weaned from mechanical ventilation, successfully extubated.  He remains on Neo- Synephrine for the next day or so due to some hypotension, his cardiac function remained good with a cardiac index of greater than 3.  His intraaortic balloon pump was weaned and subsequently discontinued on postoperative day #1.  The patient did require some intravenous fluid boluses for hypotension. On postoperative day #2, the patient had some atrial fibrillation and was placed on Amiodarone because of this. He was also begun on Lopressor at that time and begun with diuresis. The following day the patient had converted back to normal sinus rhythm.  Had remained hemodynamically stable.  Had his Neo-Synephrine drip weaned to off and was tolerating beta blocker and diuresis. Postoperative day #3, he was transferred from the intensive care unit to the telemetry floor.  His Metoprolol had been increased.  His [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain in his leg had been removed and he had begun ambulation and cardiac rehabilitation.  The patient subsequently on the telemetry floor had another episode of atrial fibrillation that was short lived on [**2164-7-10**], early in the morning that was self limiting.  His Lopressor was increased and he has not had any further episodes of atrial fibrillation.  He remains on Amiodarone and Metoprolol for this. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Today, [**2164-7-11**], is as follows: The patient is afebrile.  He is in normal sinus rhythm with a rate in the mid 70's.  His blood pressure is 120/74.  Room air oxygen saturation is 96 percent.  Neurologically he is grossly intact with no apparent deficits.  His pulmonary examination - his lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Coronary examination is regular rate and rhythm.  His abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended.  His extremities are warm without edema.  His sternal incision as well as his right leg incisions are all clean and dry with no erythema, no drainage.  The Steri-strips are intact. DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Lopressor 100 mg po bid, Lasix 20 mg po bid times seven days, Potassium Chloride 20 mEq po bid times seven days, Zantac 150 mg po bid, Aspirin 325 mg po q d, Plavix 75 mg po q d times three months.  Lipitor 20 mg po q d, Percocet 5/325 po q four hours prn pain.  The patient is also to continue on Amiodarone 400 mg po tid times one week, then decrease to 400 mg po bid times one week, then decrease 400 mg po q d times one week, and then decrease to 200 mg po q d for the remaining week.  This is the tentative plan for Amiodarone loading unless it is altered or until it is discontinued by the patient's primary cardiologist, Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 122**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
